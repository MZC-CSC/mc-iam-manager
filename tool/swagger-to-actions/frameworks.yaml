# Swagger-to-Actions Framework Configuration
# This file defines multiple frameworks and their Swagger specifications
# to be aggregated into a single serviceActions YAML file.
#
# Version Management:
# - Each framework has a 'version' field to track the active API version
# - The output file includes '_meta' with version, repository, and generatedAt
# - mc-iam-manager can load this file at init and manage version tracking in DB

# Output file path (relative to this config file)
output: ./service-actions.yaml

# HTTP timeout for fetching remote Swagger specs (in seconds)
timeout: 30
